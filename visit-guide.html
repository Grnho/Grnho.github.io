    <h2>Photography Tips</h2>
    <p>To get the most out of your visit, follow these helpful suggestions for capturing 
    beautiful sunset photos.</p>
    
    <h3>Essential Preparation</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Arrive early</em> - Come 30-45 minutes before sunset to secure a good spot and 
      watch the changing colors</li>
      <li><em>Check the weather</em> - Clear skies are best, but some clouds can add drama 
      to your photos</li>
      <li><em>Bring stability</em> - Use a tripod or find a stable surface for sharper low-light 
      shots</li>
      <li><em>Watch your exposure</em> - Sunsets can fool camera meters, so bracket your 
      exposures or use manual mode</li>
      <li><em>Include foreground interest</em> - Add silhouettes of people, boats, or structures 
      to create depth</li>
      <li><em>Stay after sunset</em> - The colors continue changing for 10-15 minutes after the 
      sun goes down</li>
    </ul>
