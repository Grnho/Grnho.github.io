    <h2>About Lake Mendota</h2>
    <p>Lake Mendota is the largest and northernmost of the four lakes in Madison, Wisconsin. 
    It covers approximately 9,781 acres and is a central feature of the University of 
    Wisconsin-Madison campus. The lake provides countless opportunities for recreation, 
    research, and appreciation of natural beauty.</p>
    
    <p>The Memorial Union Terrace offers one of the best vantage points to view the lake, 
    especially during sunset when the sky and water create spectacular color combinations.</p>

    <h2>Why the Sky Turns Pink & Blue</h2>
    <p>Have you ever wondered why sunsets look so beautiful over Lake Mendota? The answer lies 
    in the science of light and atmosphere. When sunlight travels through the Earth's atmosphere, 
    it interacts with tiny particles that change how we see different colors.</p>
    
    <dl>
      <dt>Rayleigh Scattering</dt>
      <dd>This phenomenon occurs when light hits tiny particles in the atmosphere. Shorter 
      wavelengths of light (like blue and violet) scatter more easily, which is why the sky 
      appears blue during the day. However, during sunset, sunlight travels through more 
      atmosphere, allowing longer wavelengths (like red, orange, and pink) to reach our eyes.</dd>
      
      <dt>Golden Hour</dt>
      <dd>This magical time occurs about an hour before sunset (and after sunrise). The sun 
      is low on the horizon, creating soft, warm light with beautiful shadows and minimal 
      harsh contrasts. It's called golden hour because everything appears bathed in a warm, 
      golden glow.</dd>
      
      <dt>Water Reflections</dt>
      <dd>Lake Mendota acts like a mirror, reflecting the colorful sky above. When the water 
      is calm, you get perfect mirror images of the sunset, doubling the visual impact of 
      the colors.</dd>
      
      <dt>Atmospheric Conditions</dt>
      <dd>Particles in the air, such as dust, moisture, and pollution, can enhance or change 
      the colors we see during sunset. This is why some sunsets are more vivid than others - 
      it depends on what's in the air.</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <p>Understanding these scientific concepts helps us appreciate the beauty of nature even 
    more. Next time you see a <em>spectacular sunset</em>, you'll know the <strong>science</strong> 
    behind those <small>amazing colors</small>!</p>
